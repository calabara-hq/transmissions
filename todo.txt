1. inspect gas usage

## learnings

calling logic contract is not that expensive (~25k gas)
generating fee split is not that expensive (~20k gas)


2. optimize tests
3. convert fee computations to a library
4. short circuit in cases where fees or logic is empty?

### thoughts

best case, short circuit happens before the external call.
the only way to do this is to set the implementation address to zero.

for logic, allow address 0. but this is suboptimal as creator and minter logic are seperate.
we can short circuit inside each call, and that's what we'll do. 

TODO - need to apply some rules for fees

otherwise, the next best way is to return early from inside the logic / fee contracts

5. name and position callbacks properly
